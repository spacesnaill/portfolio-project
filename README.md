# What is this?
<br>
This the source code for my portfolio website. It's originally built from a mockup provided by Udacity during the Fullstack Nanodegree porgram. This is meant to be a sort of landing page for myself, with links to GitHub projects and my social media presence.

# How was this created?
<br>
This was created using HTML5, CSS3, and a mockup pdf. While the website is not a 1-to-1 copy of the mockup, it is relatively close. A copy of the mockup can be found here: https://imgur.com/4yPnb5E. Please let me know if the link no longer works for whatever reason. This site does not feature JavaScript in any way, nor does it use any frameworks, such as Django. It does use Font Awesome for the social media icons. It is made purely from HTML and CSS and made responsive through the use of media queries and flexbox. It is possible that JavaScript may be added to the site in the future, and this documentation will be changed to reflect that. Finally, this was created using the Sublime Text Editor and tested on Safari, Chrome, and Firefox browsers, along with the Nexus 5 and iPad using the Chrome Dev Tools. Please let me know if there's an issue with the website on a particular browser or device.

# Why was this created?
<br>
This was created as part of the Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree to practice HTML and CSS and showcase my projects for the Nanodegree, along with any other projects that I've worked on outside of the Nanodegree.
